# EyeZesty

This is an application for infants.

Using eye tracking and visualization programs, parents and teachers can know the understanding words of their child.


This app will show the heatmap of child's eye detection where they're looking when they are heard some words or sentences.

ex)
word: apple, elephant
ex)
sentence: what fruit did snow-white princess eat?
